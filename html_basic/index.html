    <p>
      Hello! My name is Noble, and this is my very first portfolio project using
      HTML. I am excited to start this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy learning about technology, web development, and how websites are
      built from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is part of my practice to become comfortable with HTML basics
      and ensure my code passes validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating this portfolio, I aim to showcase my progress and future
      projects as I grow in the tech space.
    </p>
